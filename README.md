 SVG Path Extruder

 Attention! This program is no longer being maintained. It has been superceded by the Inkscape extension [Extruderz](https://github.com/obzerving/Extruderz).

Given an SVG file containing a closed path of straight lines, this program generates a paper model containing two copies of the closed path and an extrusion (or more if it exceeds 11.5 inches) represented by a strip with tabs and score lines.
